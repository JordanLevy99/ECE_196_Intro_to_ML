This repository provides an introduction to Machine Learning through a series of demos and exercises, with lecture slides to accompany them. 
The structure of the repository is as follows:
  
    /Resources 
      
      Machine_Learning.pptx -- Lecture slides for an introduction to what Machine Learning (ML) is, an overview of classical ML models, and steps of an ML project
      
      sklearn_flowchart.png -- A flowchart of sklearn models to choose from for any given dataset
  
    /ML\ Demos -- folder of all demo files of ML-related projects and exercises
      
      data/* -- all data files needed for the demos
      
      NBA_Win_Classification.ipynb -- end to end ML project for classifying when an NBA team will win. Provides a baseline model after processing and producing features for collected data.
      
      Titanic\ ML\ Demo.ipynb -- Walks through steps of a ML project and the series of problems that can be assesed with the classic Titanic dataset for Machine Learning.
      
      kNN_MNIST.ipynb -- Provides an introduction to using sklearn to apply PCA to and classify handwritten digits on the famous MNIST dataset via the kNN algorithm.
      
      sklearn_practice.ipynb -- Introduces using sklearn and seaborn on Iris dataset to apply PCA, visualize the dataset, and predict classes with Logistic Regression.
      
      sklearn_practice.pdf -- a pdf version of sklearn_practice.ipynb to be used for reference when using sklearn.
      
    /Web\ Scraping -- web-scraping exercises and examples
        
      Intro_to_Web_Scraping_exercise.ipynb -- 3 exercises introducing you to using BeautifulSoup on example.webscraping.com
        
      NBA_Data_Collection.ipynb -- example of scraping team data from stats.nba.com
      
      chromedriver.exe -- Executable for automated chrome browser (works for chrome version 87)
    
Answers to each of the files in ML_Demos/ can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10OjXyX3CjFgVij88tKi64dGIQkbpZx9V?usp=sharing.  
This folder will be updated throughout the quarter as we go over each demo.
